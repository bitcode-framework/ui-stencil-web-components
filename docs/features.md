## Platform Strengths

Before the gap list — what's already **production-solid**:

1. **JSON-driven development** — Models, APIs, processes, views, workflows — all defined in JSON. Go engine interprets at runtime.
2. **Module system (Odoo-style)** — Dependency resolution (topological sort), data seeding, cross-module views, 3-layer FS (project → global → embedded).
3. **Security stack** — JWT auth + RBAC permissions + Record Rules (row-level security) + audit logging. Full middleware chain.
4. **Process engine** — 14 step types: validate, query, create, update, delete, if, switch, loop, emit, call, script, http, assign, log. DAG executor for parallel steps.
5. **Workflow engine** — State machines with permission-gated transitions, initial state on create, process linking.
6. **Plugin system** — Multi-runtime (TypeScript, Python, goja, quickjs, yaegi), JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout, health monitoring, auto-restart. Runtime engines extracted to `packages/go-json-runtimes/` (separate go.mod). go-json programs can call external scripts via `script:` imports.
7. **View system** — 6 view types (list, form, kanban, calendar, chart, custom) with SSR rendering + layout system.
8. **Web Components** — 103 Stencil.js components: 30+ field types, layout, views, charts, dialogs, widgets (incl. 8 media viewers/players), search, social, print.
9. **Multi-database** — SQLite (zero-config default), PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB. Auto-migration from JSON definitions. Per-module table prefix, Postgres schema support. Comprehensive query builder with JSON DSL, OQL (Object Query Language — 3 syntax styles), JOINs, OR/AND/NOT groups, HAVING, DISTINCT, aggregates (COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX), subqueries, UNION, raw expressions, scopes, eager loading (WITH/preload), locking, soft delete scopes, transactions.
10. **Real-time** — WebSocket hub broadcasting domain events to connected clients.
11. **File Storage** — Local + S3 storage with attachments table, path/name formatting, thumbnails, versioning, duplicate detection.
12. **Native Shell (Tauri)** — Tauri 2.0 wraps Stencil components for desktop (Win/Mac/Linux) and mobile (iOS/Android). `bc-native.ts` bridge abstracts native capabilities (SQLite, camera, GPS, barcode, biometrics) with Web API fallback. One toggle (`mode:"offline"`) enables offline-first with auto-generated sync infrastructure.

## 1. Core Framework & Data Modeling

| # | Feature | Status | Effort | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Schema Builder | ⚠️ | L | JSON-based model definitions (`models/*.json`), parsed by `compiler/parser/model.go`. Admin UI at `/admin/models/:name` shows fields & rules. Schema tab with visual field table + JSON editor + save/validate API. | Full drag-and-drop visual builder with field palette. Current schema tab is visual table + JSON editor, not drag-and-drop yet. |
| 2 | Field Types | ✅ | — | 16+ types: string, text, integer, decimal, boolean, date, datetime, selection, email, many2one, one2many, many2many, json, file, computed. Stencil components cover 30+ field types. | — |
| 3 | Model Relationships | ✅ | — | `many2one` (FK column), `one2many` (reverse FK), `many2many` (auto junction table), `morph_to` (polymorphic belongs-to), `morph_one` (polymorphic has-one), `morph_many` (polymorphic has-many), `morph_to_many` (polymorphic M2M parent), `morph_by_many` (polymorphic M2M inverse). Morph map for type aliasing. `MigrateModel()` handles DDL. | — |
| 4 | Child Table / Inline Table | ✅ | — | `one2many` field + form view tabs embedding child views. `bc-child-table` Stencil component. | — |
| 5 | Computed / Formula Fields | ✅ | — | `computed` type defined in parser. Runtime expression evaluator (`engine/internal/runtime/expression/`) evaluates scalar formulas (`quantity * unit_price`) and aggregate expressions (`sum(lines.subtotal)`) at query time. Hydrated in repository FindByID/FindAll and view renderer. Supports: arithmetic, comparisons, boolean logic, functions (sum/count/avg/min/max/abs/round/ceil/floor/if), dot-path field access, one2many child collection aggregates. 17 tests. | — |
| 6 | Data Versioning | ✅ | — | `data_revisions` table stores full before/after snapshots on every create/update/delete via GenericRepository hooks. Monotonic per-record versioning. Admin API: `GET /admin/api/data/:model/:id/revisions`, `GET .../revisions/:version`, `POST .../restore/:version`. Restore creates new head revision. Change diff computed automatically. Cleanup support. 7 tests. | — |
| 7 | Multi-Source Data | ⚠️ | L | 3 database drivers (SQLite/Postgres/MySQL) via `DB_DRIVER`. | Only 1 database per instance. No simultaneous connections to multiple external databases. |
| 68 | Model Lifecycle Events | ✅ | — | `events` field in model JSON. 16 event types: before/after validate, create, update, delete, save, soft_delete, hard_delete, restore + on_change. Handlers can be process or script. Supports: condition expressions, sync/async, on_error (fail/log/ignore), retry with backoff, timeout, priority ordering, bulk_mode (each/batch/skip). Data modification via return-value merge. Cascade on_change with depth limit. Inherited model event merge. Auto-publish to event bus (`model.{name}.created/updated/deleted/restored`). Repository-layer injection (fires for API, process, script). Client-side onchange API: `POST /api/{model}/onchange`. Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-04-26-model-events-validation-design.md`. | — |
| 69 | Field Validation | ✅ | — | `validation` field in model JSON. 40+ built-in validators: required, email, url, phone, ip, uuid, json, alpha, alpha_num, alpha_dash, numeric, regex, starts_with, ends_with, contains, min/max, min_length/max_length, between, in/not_in, confirmed, different, gt/gte/lt/lte, date_before/after, unique (scoped, case-insensitive), exists/exists_where, min_items/max_items, file_size/file_type, immutable/immutable_after. Conditional: required_if/unless, required_with/without, exclude_if/unless, `when` condition, `on` (create/update/always). Custom validators (process/script). Model-level cross-field validators. i18n messages. Smart short-circuit per field. Partial update merge strategy. Auto-maps existing `required`/`max`/`min` fields. 422 error response with per-field errors. DB-backed unique check (scoped, case-insensitive, soft-delete aware), exists/exists_where, relation count for min_items/max_items. | — |
| 70 | Field Sanitization | ✅ | — | `sanitize` field in model JSON (per-field or model-level `_all_strings`). 14 built-in sanitizers: trim, trim_left/right, lowercase, uppercase, title_case, strip_tags, strip_whitespace, slugify, normalize_email, normalize_phone, truncate:N, escape_html. Runs before validation. Skips password fields for model-level sanitizers. | — |
| 71 | Data Migration System | ✅ | — | Laravel-style data migration/seeder. Multi-format (JSON, CSV, XLSX, XML). `migrations/` folder per module, timestamped files, `ir_migration` tracking table, batch support, up/down rollback, custom processors (script/process), field mapping, defaults, upsert/skip/error conflict modes, composite unique keys, `noupdate` (Odoo-style), `field_types` override, transaction-wrapped, tracked inserted IDs for clean rollback. MongoDB full parity via `MigrationStore` interface. Legacy `data/` seeder coordination. CLI: `bitcode seed run/rollback/status/fresh/create` with dependency-ordered execution. Auto-runs on module install. 26 tests. | — |

---

## 2. Permission & Access Control

| # | Feature | Status | Effort | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 8 | Group-Based Permission (Odoo-style) | ✅ | — | Single Group concept replaces Role+Permission. `ModelAccess` table with 12 ERPNext-style permissions (select/read/write/create/delete/print/email/report/export/import/mask/clone). Additive across groups, default-deny. Superuser bypass. `securities/*.json` per module. Admin UI with 7-tab group form. Bi-directional JSON↔DB sync. | — |
| 9 | Permission Matrix (12 permissions) | ✅ | — | `model_access` table: 12 boolean columns per model per group. `PermissionService` resolves via group chain (implied groups, recursive BFS). Middleware enforcement. Auto-derived for `auto_crud`. | — |
| 10 | Record Rules (RLS) | ✅ | — | `record_rules` with m2m groups. Domain filter with operators + `{{user.id}}` interpolation. Odoo-compatible composition: global rules INTERSECT, group rules UNION. `RecordRuleService` injects WHERE clauses. | — |
| 11 | Field-Level Permission | ✅ | — | `groups` field property: field hidden from users not in listed groups (server-side strip). `mask`/`mask_length` field property: value masked server-side for users without `can_mask` permission. Both enforced in CRUD handler before response. | — |
| 12 | Menu Access Control | ✅ | — | Menu items have `groups` field for per-group visibility. `group_menus` table. Admin UI tab. | — |
| 13 | UI Visibility Rules | ✅ | — | View actions have `"visible": "status == 'draft'"`. Form fields have `"readonly": true`. Component compiler evaluates conditions. | — |
| 14 | IP Whitelist / Session Policy | ✅ | — | IP whitelist middleware (exact IP + CIDR support, admin-only or global). Session policy: configurable JWT duration (`security.session_duration`), cookie `Secure`/`SameSite` flags. All via `security.*` config. | — |
| 15 | Plugin Permission | ⚠️ | S | Permission per module exists. Plugin scripts run in module context. | No granular per-plugin/script permission. Extend pattern to `module.plugin.script_name`. |

---

## 3. Audit Log & Monitoring

| # | Feature | Status | Effort | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 16 | Audit Log | ✅ | — | `audit_log` model with user_id, action, model_name, record_id, changes, ip_address, user_agent, request_method, request_path, status_code, duration_ms. `PersistentAuditMiddleware` writes ALL write requests to DB. `AuditLogRepository` with async writes. | — |
| 17 | Record Activity Timeline | ✅ | — | `GET /admin/api/data/:model/:id/timeline` combines `data_revisions` + `audit_log` entries. Admin model data page has "History" button per record with modal timeline showing changes with field-level diffs. | — |
| 18 | Login History | ✅ | — | Login/logout/register persisted to `audit_log` from both API auth handler and app HTML login. `POST /auth/logout` endpoint added. Admin page at `/admin/audit/login-history` with User-Agent, IP. | — |
| 19 | API Request Log | ✅ | — | `PersistentAuditMiddleware` persists all write requests to `audit_logs` table with method, path, status, duration, user, IP. Admin page at `/admin/audit/request-log` with method filtering. | — |
| 20 | Data Change Diff | ✅ | — | `data_revisions` stores structured `{field: {old, new}}` changes. Timeline modal renders field-level before/after diff with color-coded old (red strikethrough) → new (green). | — |
| 21 | Export/Import Log | ❌ | S* | — | No export/import feature exists yet (see #41, #47), so no log either. *Trivial once export/import is built. |

| 76 | go-json Core Language Engine | ✅ | — | Standalone JSON/JSONC programming language engine (`packages/go-json/`). 15 step types (let, set, if/elif/else, switch, for, while, break, continue, return, call, try/catch/finally, error, log, comment). Gradual type system (infer + strict-after-assignment + nullable + any). Function system with scope isolation and recursion. expr-lang/expr for expression evaluation (~68 built-in functions). Layer 2 stdlib (19 functions: math, strings, arrays, types). Resource limits (steps, depth, iterations, timeout). Debugger interface + execution trace. Compile-once-run-many with program cache. 75 tests. Design doc: `docs/plans/2026-07-14-runtime-engine-phase-4.5a-go-json-core-language.md`. | Phase 4.5b (structs, imports, modules) and Phase 4.5c (I/O integration with BitCode engine) not yet implemented. |

## 9. Security & Infrastructure

| # | Feature | Status | Effort | What Exists | What's Missing |
|---|---------|--------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 65 | Auth Module | ✅ | — | Embedded `auth` module with login, register, forgot password, reset, 2FA verify pages. All templates i18n-ready (11 languages). `module.json` `auth` field controls per-module auth requirement (default: true). Settings-driven: `register_enabled`, `otp_enabled`, `otp_channel`, `otp_type`. `menu_visibility: "none"` support. `?next=` redirect with sanitization. | — |
| 57 | Two-Factor Auth (2FA) | ✅ | — | Email OTP 2FA: `POST /auth/2fa/enable`, `/auth/2fa/disable`, `/auth/2fa/validate`. Login returns `requires_2fa` + temp token when 2FA enabled. OTP via SMTP email, cached with TTL, max 3 attempts. | — |
| 58 | Data Encryption | ✅ | — | Password hashing (bcrypt) + JWT signing + AES-256-GCM field-level encryption. Fields marked `"encrypted": true` in model JSON get transparent encrypt-on-write / decrypt-on-read. Key versioning (`v1:` prefix) for future rotation. | — |
| 59 | Backup & Restore | ✅ | — | `bitcode db backup [path]` and `bitcode db restore [path]`. Driver-aware: SQLite file copy, PostgreSQL pg_dump/psql, MySQL mysqldump/mysql. Supports `--gzip` compression and `--force` restore. Metadata JSON per backup. | Scheduled backups (depends on cron + storage). |
| 60 | Rate Limiting | ✅ | — | Fiber limiter middleware. Global rate limit (default 100/min) + stricter auth endpoint limit (5/min). Configurable via `rate_limit.*` config. Returns 429 with `Retry-After` header. | — |
| 61 | CSRF & XSS Protection | ⚠️ | S | XSS: Go html/template auto-escapes. API uses JWT (stateless, no CSRF needed). Current SSR forms use HTTPOnly JWT cookie (low risk). | CSRF token needed for future public web forms (job portal, contact forms, website module). Will implement when public web forms feature is built. |
| 62 | Soft Delete / Recycle Bin | ✅ | — | Model-level `soft_deletes: true` adds `deleted_at` column. DELETE sets `deleted_at = NOW()` + `active = false`. `FindAll`/`Count`/`Sum` exclude soft-deleted records (`deleted_at IS NULL`). Active variants (`FindAllActive`, `FindActive`, `CountActive`, `SumActive`, `PaginateActive`) filter by `active = true`. `active` is a separate business field (inactive ≠ deleted). Optimistic locking via `version: true`. Conditional timestamps/timestamps_by. | Recycle bin UI to view and restore deleted records (effort S). |
| 63 | Admin Impersonation | ✅ | — | Token-based impersonation: `POST /admin/api/impersonate/:user_id` (admin-only, cannot impersonate other admins, 1h TTL). `POST /admin/api/stop-impersonate` returns admin token. JWT `impersonated_by` claim. All audit logs include `impersonated_by` field. | — |
| 64 | Email Infrastructure | ✅ | — | SMTP email sender (`pkg/email`). Configurable via `smtp.*` config (host, port, user, password, from, TLS). HTML email templates. Used by 2FA, reusable for notifications, password reset, scheduled reports. | — |

## Web Components Status

The `@bitcode/components` Stencil library (94 components) provides rich UI widgets. Many are **built but not yet wired** to the engine's SSR rendering:

| Category | Components | Count | Engine Integration |
|----------|------------|-------|--------------------|
| Fields | string, text, richtext, code, date, select, link, file, image, signature, barcode, geo, rating, json, etc. | 34 | ⚠️ Component compiler maps some; SSR uses Go templates |

| Other | placeholder | 1 | — |
| Editor | bc-view-editor (drag-drop form layout builder) | 1 | ✅ Wired to admin panel |
| **Total** | | **95** | |

**Key gap**: Components are built but the engine primarily uses SSR (Go templates). Full SPA mode with client-side component rendering is not yet implemented.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Quick Wins (1–2 weeks, effort S)

Low-hanging fruit that immediately improves the platform:

- [ ] **#14** IP Whitelist / Session Policy — middleware for IP check + JWT expiry config
- [ ] **#15** Plugin Permission (granular) — extend permission pattern to `module.plugin.script_name`
- [ ] **#18** Login History view — extend audit_log fields + dedicated view
- [ ] **#20** Data Change Diff UI — store old_value/new_value per field + diff component
- [ ] **#46** API Key Management — api_key model + auth middleware accepting API key header
- [ ] **#52** Branding / White Label — branding settings (logo, app name, color) + template injection
- [ ] **#60** Rate Limiting — gofiber/limiter middleware
- [ ] **#61** CSRF Protection — CSRF middleware for SSR form routes
- [ ] **#62** Recycle Bin UI — filter `active = false` view + restore endpoint

### Phase 2 — Core Gaps (3–4 weeks, effort M)

Features most requested by users and blocking other features:

- [ ] **#5** Computed Field Evaluator — expression parser + evaluator at query time
- [ ] **#11** Field-Level Permission — per-field permission config in model JSON + API/form filter
- [ ] **#17** Record Activity Timeline — API endpoint + timeline UI component
- [ ] **#27** Assignment Rules — assignment rule JSON definition + evaluator on create/update
- [ ] **#28** Webhook System — webhook definition (URL, events, headers) + event bus dispatcher
- [ ] **#33** Multi-Step Form / Wizard — wire `bc-dialog-wizard` component + wizard JSON definition
- [ ] **#35** Web Form (Public) — public form route (bypass auth) + CAPTCHA + rate limiting
- [ ] **#41** Export Data (CSV/Excel) — server-side export handler per model
- [ ] **#57** 2FA (TOTP) — TOTP library + setup flow + verification middleware
- [ ] **#59** Backup & Restore — db dump/restore commands + optional scheduling
- [ ] **#63** Comment & Mention — comment model + API + wire `bc-chatter` component
- [ ] **#67** In-App Notification — notification model + preferences + bell UI + WebSocket delivery

### Phase 3 — Visual Builders (6–8 weeks, effort L)

The gap between "JSON-code" and true "low-code":

- [ ] **#1** Visual Schema Builder — frontend CRUD for model JSON + field type picker + relation builder
- [ ] **#22** Visual Workflow Builder — frontend state machine editor (nodes + edges + properties)
- [ ] **#30** Visual Form Builder — drag-and-drop form designer outputting JSON layout
- [ ] **#34** Print Format / PDF — print template JSON + PDF renderer (wkhtmltopdf/chromedp/gotenberg)
- [ ] **#38** Report Builder — report JSON definition (columns, filters, group_by, aggregations) + renderer
- [ ] **#47** Data Import / Export Wizard — upload → map columns → validate → insert

### Phase 4.5 — Runtime Engine Redesign (go-json)

JSON/JSONC programming language engine replacing process engine scripting:

- [x] **#76** go-json Core Language (Phase 4.5a) — standalone `packages/go-json/` with 15 step types, gradual types, functions, stdlib, resource limits, debugger, 75 tests
- [ ] **Phase 4.5b** go-json Modularity — structs, imports, module system, codegen
- [ ] **Phase 4.5c** go-json I/O Integration — I/O modules, BitCode engine integration, process engine routing

### Phase 4 — Enterprise Features (8–12 weeks, effort L–XL)

Enterprise-grade capabilities:

- [ ] **#7** Multi-Source Data — connection pool manager for multiple datasources
- [ ] **#26** Email / Notification Automation — SMTP config, email queue, template engine
- [ ] **#42** Pivot Table — server-side pivot engine + wire `bc-chart-pivot` component
- [ ] **#45** OAuth2 / SSO — OAuth2 client (Google, Microsoft, GitHub) + LDAP connector
- [ ] **#49** GraphQL API — schema generator from model definitions + resolver layer
- [ ] **#54** Multi-Currency — currency model + exchange rate table + conversion logic
- [ ] **#55** Multi-Company — company model + company-level settings + inter-company transactions
- [ ] **#64** Activity Feed — feed API (aggregate audit_log + comments) + wire `bc-activity` component
- [ ] **#66** Task / To-Do per Record — todo model + API + UI widget

### Phase 5 — Ecosystem (ongoing)

- [ ] **#43** Scheduled Reports — depends on email (#26) + report builder (#38)
- [ ] **#48** Third-Party Connectors — connector framework + individual implementations
- [ ] **#65** Email Inbox Integration — IMAP client + email parsing + thread linking
- [ ] **AGENTS.md** Redis cache wiring — wire into permission checker and query result cache
- [ ] **AGENTS.md** NATS event bus — replace in-process bus for distributed deployments
- [ ] **AGENTS.md** Marketplace — community module sharing
- [ ] **SPA Mode** — full client-side rendering using Stencil components (currently SSR only)

## Bridge API Tech Debt (Phase 1)

Known limitations in the Bridge API (`engine/internal/runtime/bridge/`) that will be addressed in subsequent phases:

| # | Item | Current State | Target | Phase |
|---|------|--------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Storage + AttachmentRepository | `storage_bridge.go` wraps `StorageDriver` only | Integrate `AttachmentRepository` for metadata tracking, thumbnails, versioning | 1 (iteration 2) |
| 2 | Email template rendering | `email.go` sends raw HTML body only | Support `template` + `data` fields via Go `html/template` engine | 1 (iteration 2) |
| 3 | Notify user targeting | `notify.go` broadcasts to channel `notification:{userID}` | Add `SendToUser(userID, msg)` method on Hub that filters by `Client.UserID` | 1 (iteration 2) |
| 4 | Execution log cleanup cron | `execution.go` has config but no cleanup goroutine | Add cron-based cleanup using `max_age` + `max_records` from `ExecutionLogConfig` | 1 (iteration 2) |
| 5 | Execution retry | `execution.Retry()` returns "not yet implemented" | Re-run process with same input, link via `parent_id` | 1 (iteration 2) |
| 6 | Executor integration | `executor.go` not yet wrapped with execution log recording | Wrap `Execute()` to auto-record `process_execution` + per-step logging | 1 (iteration 2) |
| 7 | BulkUpdate hooks | `BulkUpdate` skips before/after hooks for performance | Add opt-in hook dispatch for bulk operations | 6B |
| 8 | BulkDelete hooks | `BulkDelete` skips before/after hooks for performance | Same as above | 6B |
| 9 | QuickJS unit tests | Only compile check, no VM execution tests | Add VM execution tests | 4 (iteration 2) |
| 10 | yaegi go.mod per module | Not implemented | `bitcode module extract-deps` CLI + `yaegi extract` pipeline | 5 (iteration 2) |
